# Support Desk

## Description

Creating this React application was key to understanding the foundations of React.
This project was built so that I would have an additional project to reference when creating future full stack applications.
The Support Desk App is where tech consumers can go to get there product issues resolved from staff.
Walking through Brad Traversy's explanation was extremely helpful. Understanding React and its components is becoming easier and easier.
